# Federation

Open Terms Archive is a decentralised system. It aims at enabling any entity to track terms on its own. To that end, the Open Terms Archive engine can be run on any server, thus making it a dedicated instance.
In order to maximise discoverability, collaboration and political power, public collections are federated within a single ecosystem. This makes their data mutually discoverable and enables mutualising effort.

### Referencing an instance

A **collection** can be **referenced** in the Open Terms Archive **federation** if it abides by the following quality criteria:

1. Clearly defined **scope**.
2. Clearly defined **maintainer**.
3. Clearly defined **administrator**.
4. The vast majority of **versions** are readable.
5. **Frequency** of at least one track a day.
6. Public and open-licensed **snapshots**.
7. Public and open-licensed **versions**.
8. Regular, public, and open-licensed **dataset** releases.
