# How to subscribe to terms changes

An RSS feed is a type of web page that contains information about the latest content published by a website, such as the date of publication and the address where you can view it. When this resource is updated, a feed reader app automatically notifies you and you can see the update. You can receive notification for a specific service or document by subscribing to RSS feeds.

## For a specific document

To find out the address of the RSS feed you want to subscribe to:

1. [Navigate]({{< relref "terms/navigate-trough-versions-history" >}}) to the page with the history of changes you are interested in.
    - For example, for the GitHub Privacy Policy of the Demo instance, this would be [this page](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/demo-versions/commits/main/GitHub/Privacy%20Policy.md).
2. Copy the address of that page from your browserâ€™s address bar.
    - For example, for the GitHub Privacy Policy of the Demo instance, this would be `https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/demo-versions/commits/main/GitHub/Privacy%20Policy.md`.
3. Append `.atom` at the end of this address.
    - For example, for the GitHub Privacy Policy of the Demo instance, this would become `https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/demo-versions/commits/main/GitHub/Privacy%20Policy.md.atom`.
4. Subscribe your RSS feed reader to the resulting address.
