### Step 3: Receive feedback

1. **Await feedback**: The core team will provide feedback through the same channel you used to submit your request.

### Step 4: Agree on a timeline

1. **Discuss timeline**: If approved, collaborate with the core team to establish a timeline for joining the federation.
