# Collection governance

Setting up and maintaining a collection is done by fulfilling certain tasks. These tasks are handled through roles.

1. A **curator**, who decides what services and terms are welcome in the collection.
2. A **host**, who ensures that a server is available.
3. An **administrator**, who takes responsibility for ensuring that the engine and associated software tools are functional and up to date.
4. **Maintainers**, who guarantee the quality of the tracked versions by reviewing contributions.
5. **Contributors**, who add declarations and keep them up to date.

Each of these roles can be volunteer or paid, and all can be handled by one single or several different entities.

The Open Terms Archive core team provides processes and tools to support all of these roles.
