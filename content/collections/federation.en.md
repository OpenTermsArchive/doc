# Federation

Open Terms Archive is a decentralised system. It aims at enabling any entity set up their own collections and track terms on their own.

In order to maximise discoverability, collaboration and political power, public collections are federated within a single ecosystem. This makes their data mutually discoverable and enables mutualising effort.

## Benefits

A collection that **joins** the **federation** enjoys the following benefits:

1. Visibility on the Open Terms Archive website lists of collections and datasets.
2. Access to the Open Terms Archive GitHub organisation, administered by the Open Terms Archive core team.
3. Collection logo provided by the Open Terms Archive core team.
4. Referencing in the official [collections list](https://opentermsarchive.org/collections.json), enabling off-the-shelf discovery in the [Federated API]({{< relref "api/federated" >}}).
5. Public announcement through all Open Terms Archive communication channels upon joining.

## Criteria

A **collection** can **join** the Open Terms Archive **federation** if it abides by the following quality criteria:

1. Clearly defined [collection metadata]({{< relref "collections/metadata" >}}).
2. Clearly defined [collection governance]({{< relref "collections/governance" >}}).
3. The vast majority of **versions** are readable, as evidenced by a sample assessment.
4. **Frequency** of at least one track a day, as evidenced by snapshots.
5. Public and open-licensed **declarations**, as evidenced by the `LICENSE` file in the declarations repository.
6. Public and open-licensed **snapshots**, as evidenced by the `LICENSE` file in the snapshots repository.
7. Public and open-licensed **versions**, as evidenced by the `LICENSE` file in the versions repository.
8. Regular, public, and open-licensed **dataset** releases, as evidenced by the `LICENSE` file in the datasets.
9. Publicly accessible API with median response time under 20ms, as evidenced by uptime tracking logs.
10. Abide by all Open Terms Archive software and data licenses.

## Disclaimer

Please note that establishing the federation is an ongoing effort. While criteria are assessed and refined to strike the right balance between accessibility and quality, the Open Terms Archive core team is responsible for assessing which collections may join the federation, and has the right to update the criteria as requests for joining are made.
