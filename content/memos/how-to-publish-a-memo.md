# How to publish a memo

This guide will help you publish a memo on [opentermsarchive.org/en/memos](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/). No special computer skills are required to achieve this.

## Prerequisites

- A drafted memo compliant with the [writing reference]({{< relref "/memos/writing-reference" >}}).

## 1. Sending

Send your memo to [{{< param email >}}](mailto:{{< param email >}}?subject=Publish%20a%20memo) by attaching it to the body of the email or as a file attachment. Please feel free to add any comments or questions you may have about the content or format.

## 2. Reviewing

The Open Terms Archive core team will review your memo as quickly as possible. If necessary, we will suggest changes and discuss them with you. Note that review times may vary depending on the number of changes required, the speed of exchanges, and the availability of reviewers. If you do not hear from us within two weeks, please do not hesitate to contact us again by the means of your choice.

## 3. Promoting

Once the technical team has published your memo on [opentermsarchive.org/en/memos](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/), we will inform you and provide you with the URL address for your memo. You should then promote it through the media and to the people you consider appropriate. Whenever possible, we suggest associating the hashtag `#TermsSpotting` with your memo promotions.
