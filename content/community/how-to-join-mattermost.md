## Profile setup

Once you're all set on Mattermost, the next thing is to set up your profile. A complete profile sets you up for meaningful interactions and connections with members interested in tracking the same terms.  
  
This includes adding your full name, user name, pseudo (nickname), role, and profile picture. New members can set up their profiles by following these steps.

1. Navigate to the uppermost right corner of Mattermost and click on the profile icon
