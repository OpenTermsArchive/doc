This repository is dedicated for volunteer contribution of declarations to Open Terms Archive.
Having understood briefly how a declaration is structured in JSON format, we need to look at concrete steps on how you can add these JSON files to the repository.

Therefore, to apply a service renaming, open a pull request that both terminates the previous service and adds a new service declaration with the new service name. You can reuse the documents part of the original declaration, but should double-check that the selectors and URLs still match, as a service rename is most often accompanied by a new page layout, a new domain name, and sometimes entirely new terms.</description></item><item><title>How to terminate a service</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/how-to/terminate-a-service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/how-to/terminate-a-service/</guid><description> How to terminate a service If the service provider stops offering a service, the associated terms will become unavailable. To mark that service termination in Open Terms Archive and ensure tracking tentatives are stopped, while maintaining the possibility to explore the history:
Move the existing documents declaration to the service history file. Update the declaration to stop tracking all terms, by removing every &amp;lt;terms type&amp;gt; entries from the documents key in the declaration: { &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;&amp;lt;service name&amp;gt;&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;documents&amp;#34;: {} }</description></item></channel></rss>
