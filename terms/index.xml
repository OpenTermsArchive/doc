The process of updating these elements to enable continued tracking is called maintenance. Without it, terms can become:
unreachable: no snapshot can be recorded at all, because the location changed or the service denies access; unextractable: no version can be extracted from the snapshot, because the selection of content or some filter fails; noisy: both snapshots and versions are recorded but the changes contain noise that should have been filtered out.</description></item></channel></rss>
