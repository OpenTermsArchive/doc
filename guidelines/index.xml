Normative constraints are exposed in Contributing Terms.
Declaring documents Service name Casing In order to find the service name casing, rely first on the page title (easily found in search results). Do not rely on the logo as it can be stylized differently. Example with Facebook: If it is still ambiguous, rely on Wikipedia as a source. However, make sure to differentiate the service from the provider company&amp;rsquo;s name.</description></item><item><title>Reviewing contributions</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/reviewing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/reviewing/</guid><description>Reviewing contributions Thank you for showing interest in reviewing contributions made to Open Terms Archive.

Can I track terms that are not applicable yet? Yes.
For example, documents that would start applying at date in the future are legitimate candidates for tracking. You can this way track if their terms change even before they are applied.</description></item></channel></rss>
