What are selectors 🔗 Selectors are used in the select and remove keys of an Open Terms Archive declaration.
The “selectors” referred to are defined by the W3C Selectors standard, more commonly known as “CSS Selectors”.
An easy-to-read introduction to CSS Selectors can be found on mdn web docs.</description></item><item><title>Declaring documents</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/declaring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/declaring/</guid><description>This document presents practical guidelines, is edited collaboratively and is not normative.

If it is still ambiguous, rely on Wikipedia as a source.</description></item><item><title>Reviewing contributions</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/reviewing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/reviewing/</guid><description>Reviewing contributions Thank you for showing interest in reviewing contributions made to Open Terms Archive.
