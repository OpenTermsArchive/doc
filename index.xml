It aims at enabling any entity set up their own collections and track terms on their own.
In order to maximise discoverability, collaboration and political power, public collections are federated within a single ecosystem. This makes their data mutually discoverable and enables mutualising effort.
Benefits of joining the federation 🔗 A collection that joins the federation enjoys the following benefits:</description></item><item><title>Command line interface</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/api/cli/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/api/cli/</guid><description>Command line interface Once the engine module is installed as a dependency within another module, the ota command with the following subcommands is available.
In these commands:
&amp;lt;service_id&amp;gt; is the case sensitive name of the service declaration file without the extension. For example, for Twitter.json, the service ID is Twitter. &amp;lt;terms_type&amp;gt; is the property name used under the documents property in the declaration to declare a terms. For example, in the getting started declaration, the terms type declared is Privacy Policy.</description></item><item><title>Create repositories</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/how-to/create-repositories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/how-to/create-repositories/</guid><description>How to create collection repositories Collections in Open Terms Archive rely on three Git repositories to hold the data:
Declarations repository: stores the declarations that define terms to track Snapshots repository: stores raw snapshots of tracked documents Versions repository: stores processed versions of tracked documents This guide assumes you use GitHub. For other Git platforms, adapt these steps accordingly.
Prerequisites 🔗 Before starting, ensure you have:
A GitHub account with permissions to create repositories Your collection ID and name defined Your collection metadata prepared Create declarations repository 🔗 Create from template 🔗 Go to the demo-declarations repository Click &amp;ldquo;Use this template&amp;rdquo; dropdown and select &amp;ldquo;Create a new repository&amp;rdquo; Name it &amp;lt;collection_id&amp;gt;-declarations (e.</description></item><item><title>Create your first collection</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/tutorials/create/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/tutorials/create/</guid><description>Create your first collection This tutorial will guide you through creating your first Open Terms Archive collection.
By the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a working collection that tracks changes to a service&amp;rsquo;s privacy policy. You will also have a basic understanding of how to create a collection.
Prerequisites 🔗 Node.js is installed on your system. You have basic familiarity with the command line. You know how to use a text editor.</description></item><item><title>Deploy a collection</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/deployment/how-to/deploy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/deployment/how-to/deploy/</guid><description>How to deploy a collection This guide will help you deploy an Open Terms Archive collection to a server.
1. Configure the server 🔗 First, ensure your server provides unsupervised access:
Check the SSH host key:
ssh-keyscan --type=ed25519 &amp;lt;server_address&amp;gt; If no Ed25519 key appears, generate one on the server:
sudo ssh-keygen --type=ed25519 --file=/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key sudo systemctl restart ssh Create a non-root user if needed:
adduser &amp;lt;user&amp;gt; usermod --append --groups=sudo &amp;lt;user&amp;gt; Grant passwordless sudo access:</description></item><item><title>Main concepts</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/concepts/main/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/concepts/main/</guid><description>Main concepts 🔗 Words in bold are business domain names.
Services have terms written in documents, contractual (Terms of Services, Privacy Policy…) or not (Community Guidelines, Deceased User Policy…), that can change over time. Open Terms Archive enables users rights advocates, regulatory bodies and interested citizens to follow the changes to these terms, to be notified whenever a new version is published, to explore their entire history and to collaborate in analysing them.</description></item><item><title>Metadata</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/reference/metadata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/reference/metadata/</guid><description>Collection metadata This reference documentation details all available metadata fields that can be specified in a collection&amp;rsquo;s metadata file.

Such a declaration is achieved by editing JSON files in the declarations folder.
Before adding new terms, open the declarations folder and check if the service you want to track terms for is already declared. If a JSON file with the name of the service is already present, you can jump straight to the Terms reference.</description></item><item><title>Create a collection</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/how-to/create/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/how-to/create/</guid><description>How to create a collection You are considering creating a new collection to track terms with Open Terms Archive? Amazing!
Define metadata 🔗 First of all, define the metadata of the collection you would like to create and keep them ready to be used when setting up the repositories.

What are selectors 🔗 Selectors are used in the select and remove keys of an Open Terms Archive declaration.
The “selectors” referred to are defined by the W3C Selectors standard, more commonly known as “CSS Selectors”.
An easy-to-read introduction to CSS Selectors can be found on mdn web docs.</description></item><item><title>Copywriting</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/analysis/reference/copywriting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/analysis/reference/copywriting/</guid><description>Copywriting reference Each memo must be composed of the elements detailed below. You must follow this structure when writing your memos.
Title 🔗 Write a short declarative sentence to highlight the key change. 140 characters maximum. Use the name of the service as the subject. Write in the present tense. Prefer active phrasings over passive (e.g., “Microsoft expands reach” rather than “Reach expanded by Microsoft“). Describe the policy change, not the name of the document.</description></item><item><title>Declaration format</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/reference/declaration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/reference/declaration/</guid><description>Terms declaration format reference Terms are declared in a service declaration file, under the documents property.
Most of the time, terms are written in only one source document (for example Facebook Terms of Service) but sometimes terms can be spread across multiple online source documents, and their combination constitutes the terms (for example Facebook Community Guidelines).
Source document 🔗 The way in which a source document is obtained is defined in a JSON object:</description></item><item><title>Declaring terms</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/guidelines/declaring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/guidelines/declaring/</guid><description>Declaring terms Service name 🔗 Casing 🔗 In order to find the service name casing, rely first on the page title (easily found in search results). Do not rely on the logo as it can be stylized differently. Example with Facebook:
If it is still ambiguous, rely on Wikipedia as a source. However, make sure to differentiate the service from the provider company&amp;rsquo;s name. Example with “DeviantArt”, a service (which used to be stylized deviantArt until 2014) by the limited liability company “deviantArt”:</description></item><item><title>How to get the `validUntil`</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/how-to/get-the-validuntil-date-from-an-issue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/how-to/get-the-validuntil-date-from-an-issue/</guid><description>How to get the validUntil date From a GitHub issue 🔗 Go to the open issue and scroll to the last action from OTA-Bot (comment or issue opening).

Therefore, to apply a service renaming, open a pull request that both terminates the previous service and adds a new service declaration with the new service name. You can reuse the documents part of the original declaration, but should double-check that the selectors and URLs still match, as a service rename is most often accompanied by a new page layout, a new domain name, and sometimes entirely new terms.</description></item><item><title>Reviewing contributions</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/guidelines/reviewing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/guidelines/reviewing/</guid><description>Reviewing contributions Thank you for showing interest in reviewing contributions made to Open Terms Archive.
