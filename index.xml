Such a declaration is achieved by editing JSON files in the declarations folder.
Before adding new terms, open the declarations folder and check if the service you want to track terms for is already declared. If a JSON file with the name of the service is already present, you can jump straight to declaring terms.</description></item><item><title>Design principles</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/design-principles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/design-principles/</guid><description>Design principles These overarching principles guide technical and governance decisions. They are fundamental and can only be changed through community consensus, based on a thorough impact assessment.
Each principle has a name, a rationale, and potential implementation examples or guidelines.
1. Never trust the services A major goal of Open Terms Archive is to enable assessing the loyalty of services towards their end users. Since loyalty is not assumed, trust can not be warranted.</description></item><item><title>Federation</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/federation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/federation/</guid><description>Federation Open Terms Archive is a decentralised system. It aims at enabling any entity set up their own collections and track terms on their own.
In order to maximise discoverability, collaboration and political power, public collections are federated within a single ecosystem. This makes their data mutually discoverable and enables mutualising effort.
Benefits A collection that joins the federation enjoys the following benefits:
Visibility on the Open Terms Archive website lists of collections and datasets.</description></item><item><title>API</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/api/</guid><description>API Node.js [Beta] As a Node module dependency, the engine exposes a JavaScript API that can be called in your own code. The following modules are available.
fetch The fetch module gets the MIME type and content of a document from its URL
import fetch from &amp;#39;@opentermsarchive/engine/fetch&amp;#39;; Documentation on how to use fetch is provided as JSDoc.
Headless browser management If you pass the executeClientScripts option to fetch, a headless browser will be used to download and execute the page before serialising its DOM.</description></item><item><title>Browsing through terms</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/navigate-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/navigate-history/</guid><description>Browsing through terms Every collection offers a public database of versions they recorded.
For this guide, we will use the example of the Demo collection. The terms of this collection are published on the OpenTermsArchive/demo-versions repository.
From the repository page, open the folder of the service of your choice by clicking on it. For example, GitHub:
You will see the set of terms tracked for that service, now click on the terms of your choice.</description></item><item><title>Subscribing to terms changes</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/subscribe-rss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/subscribe-rss/</guid><description>Subscribing to terms changes An RSS feed is a type of web page that contains information about the latest content published by a website, such as the date of publication and the address where you can view it. When this resource is updated, a feed reader app automatically notifies you and you can see the update. You can receive notification for a specific service or document by subscribing to RSS feeds.</description></item><item><title>Choosing selectors</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/choosing-selectors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/choosing-selectors/</guid><description>Choosing selectors Selectors are used in Open Terms Archive declarations to specify the parts of documents that should be recorded.
What are selectors Selectors are used in the select and remove keys of an Open Terms Archive declaration.
The “selectors” referred to are defined by the W3C Selectors standard, more commonly known as “CSS Selectors”.
An easy-to-read introduction to CSS Selectors can be found on mdn web docs.
Choosing durable selectors eases maintenance The design of web pages containing terms can evolve over time, leading to changes in their HTML (more precisely, to their DOM) which may render ineffective the selectors that were initially chosen.</description></item><item><title>Creating a collection</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/create/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/create/</guid><description>Creating a collection Define the necessary metadata First of all, define the metadata and governance of the collection.
Create repositories Declarations Create the collection declarations repository by using the demo-declarations repository as template:
Go to the demo-declarations repository Click on the “Use this template” dropdown and select “Create a new repository” Set the repository name to &amp;lt;collection_id&amp;gt;-declarations. For example: pga-declarations. When redirected to the newly generated repository, wait a minute or two for the automatic setup to run.</description></item><item><title>Declaring documents</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/declaring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/declaring/</guid><description>This document presents practical guidelines, is edited collaboratively and is not normative. Normative constraints are exposed in Contributing Terms.
Declaring documents Service name Casing In order to find the service name casing, rely first on the page title (easily found in search results). Do not rely on the logo as it can be stylized differently. Example with Facebook: If it is still ambiguous, rely on Wikipedia as a source. However, make sure to differentiate the service from the provider company&amp;rsquo;s name.</description></item><item><title>Governance</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/governance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/governance/</guid><description>Collection governance Setting up and maintaining a collection is done by fulfilling certain tasks. These tasks are handled through roles.
A curator, who decides what services and terms are welcome in the collection. A host, who ensures that a server is available. An administrator, who takes responsibility for ensuring that the engine and associated software tools are functional and up to date. Maintainers, who guarantee the quality of the tracked versions by reviewing contributions.</description></item><item><title>Metadata</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/metadata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/metadata/</guid><description>Collection metadata A collection is defined by the following metadata:
Concise description of the collection topic (examples: Largest global social media, Most used social media in France, Dating apps, Platforms providing services to businesses…). Collection name (3 words maximum, examples: Platform Governance Archive, France Élections, Dating, P2B Compliance Assessment…). Collection ID (examples: pga, France-elections, dating, p2b-compliance…). Terms language (examples: English, French, All EU languages…). Terms jurisdiction (examples: EU, France, EEA, USA, global…).</description></item><item><title>Reviewing contributions</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/reviewing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/reviewing/</guid><description>Reviewing contributions Thank you for showing interest in reviewing contributions made to Open Terms Archive.

We also want to make sure that the contributions are reviewed in a timely manner so that the contributors can get feedback and continue to contribute to the project.</description></item><item><title>Targeting</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/targeting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/targeting/</guid><description>What to track? Can I track terms that are not applicable yet? Yes.
For example, documents that would start applying at date in the future are legitimate candidates for tracking. You can this way track if their terms change even before they are applied.</description></item></channel></rss>
