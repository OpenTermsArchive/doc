Such a declaration is achieved by editing JSON files in the declarations folder.
Before adding new terms, open the declarations folder and check if the service you want to track terms for is already declared. If a JSON file with the name of the service is already present, you can jump straight to declaring terms.</description></item><item><title>Design principles</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/design-principles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/design-principles/</guid><description>Design principles These overarching principles guide technical and governance decisions. They are fundamental and can only be changed through community consensus, based on a thorough impact assessment.
Each principle has a name, a rationale, and potential implementation examples or guidelines.
1. Never trust the services A major goal of Open Terms Archive is to enable assessing the loyalty of services towards their end users. Since loyalty is not assumed, trust can not be warranted.</description></item><item><title>Governance</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/governance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/governance/</guid><description>Governance Instances Creating an instance Each instance has an administrator who takes responsibility for ensuring that the engine is up to date and works properly, and maintainers who take responsibility for ensuring the quality of the resulting versions.
All of these roles can be either volunteer or funded by sponsors. Anyone is free to create their own collection using their own instance.
Referencing an instance A collection can be referenced in the Open Terms Archive federation if it abides by the following quality criteria:</description></item><item><title>Browsing through terms</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/navigate-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/navigate-history/</guid><description>Browsing through terms Every collection offers a public database of versions they recorded.
For this guide, we will use the example of the Demo collection. The terms of this collection are published on the OpenTermsArchive/demo-versions repository.
From the repository page, open the folder of the service of your choice by clicking on it. For example, GitHub:
You will see the set of terms tracked for that service, now click on the terms of your choice.</description></item><item><title>Subscribing to terms changes</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/subscribe-rss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/subscribe-rss/</guid><description>Subscribing to terms changes An RSS feed is a type of web page that contains information about the latest content published by a website, such as the date of publication and the address where you can view it. When this resource is updated, a feed reader app automatically notifies you and you can see the update. You can receive notification for a specific service or document by subscribing to RSS feeds.</description></item><item><title>Declaring documents</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/declaring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/declaring/</guid><description>This document presents practical guidelines, is edited collaboratively and is not normative. Normative constraints are exposed in Contributing Terms.
Declaring documents Service name Casing In order to find the service name casing, rely first on the page title (easily found in search results). Do not rely on the logo as it can be stylized differently. Example with Facebook: If it is still ambiguous, rely on Wikipedia as a source. However, make sure to differentiate the service from the provider company&amp;rsquo;s name.</description></item><item><title>Reviewing contributions</title><link>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/reviewing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/reviewing/</guid><description>Reviewing contributions Thank you for showing interest in reviewing contributions made to Open Terms Archive.

Can I track terms that are not applicable yet? Yes.
For example, documents that would start applying at date in the future are legitimate candidates for tracking. You can this way track if their terms change even before they are applied.</description></item></channel></rss>
