That request should contain all necessary content or links that enable assessing the criteria.
The core team will confirm reception of the request and assess the criteria within 4 weeks. The result of the assessment will be provided to the requester through the same means the request was sent, along with a positive decision or a list of improvements that need to be done before a new request can be sent.</description></item></channel></rss>
